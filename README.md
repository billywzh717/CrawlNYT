# CrawlNYT
 
With those code you can collect Multimodal New York Times by your self.

## Steps

1. First of all, you need to apply a NYT developer account and get a api key and fill it into retrieve_all_urls.py 
2. Then you can use retrieve_all_url.py to crawl the multimodal news' meta information.
3. With those meta information, then you can use get_data_api.py to crawl the actual news.
4. In step 3 you will obtain all the NYT news in target years. And if you want to select specific news categories, you can use 
get_category_image_text.py.
